## Inspiration

A virus epidemic struck Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. The Chinese government took action and stopped the transition system after Jan 23, 2020. Medical supplies ran out quickly in China and slowly to the world. We were sorry for the virus outbreak in China and wished to do more to help people in need.

## What it does
In our website, we aimed to produce a method for people and organizations to find medical supplies during the time of crisis like the Wuhan virus. People and organizations around the world will be able to get medical supplies such as masks from close-by donors who have extra medical supplies.

## How we built it
We built a UX prototype first. Based on the prototype, we built front-end with html/css and back-end with flask separately and integrated them. We used Google Map API on both front-end and back-end to assist with our geo-location-related functionalities.

## What's next for MedUnicorn
We will improve the frontend of the project with the UI prototype we had and implement more functions

## Difficulties
Connecting backend to front end is a difficulty for us since none of us have that kind of experience before. After we have all the individual parts working and passed the unit tests we created, we have to learn flask on the spot.
